Biologist, bioinformatician and director of [SLU's bioinformatics infrastructure](www.slubi.se). 

I am a trained biologist and theoretical ecologist. My bioinformatics expertise is in analysing RNAseq, methylation data, microarrays, and 10x single cell RNAseq data. I enjoy training and connecting people.
