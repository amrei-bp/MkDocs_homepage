# R
R is a common coding language used in bioinformatics.
[R for Data Science (2e)](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) is an excellent place to start your journey into R. 

If you prefer learning through self-paced courses:
[Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-analyst-r/) has a free, self-paced course.
[CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r) has a free course, but you will have to pay for the certificate.

And, of course, our [3 Bees workshop series](https://www.slubi.se/3BS.html)!


# Bash
Most servers run on a Unix build. It is intimidating to start with a new interface, but with these guides things will be a lot smoother!

Data Carpentry's [Intro to the shell](https://datacarpentry.org/2015-11-04-ACUNS/shell-intro/) is a great place to start when you are a new user of Linux. As is the [The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/), a self paced introduction to the unix shell and command line operations, provided by the Software Carpentries. 

If you don't have access to a server yet, and would like to practice on your local Windows machine, download [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download.html) and run a shell session on your Windows machine.
If you are using a Mac, you will be able to follow the tutorial from the terminal that comes with your operating system.

# Visual Studio Code
Traditionally, Windows users had to connect to servers using PuTTy or a similar interface. We recommend making use of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) that comes with your Windows operating system (it can also be installed on machines that run Linux builds and MacOS).

With VSCode, you can connect to servers using [ssh](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh), install extensions supporting a variety of coding languages, write and render markdown documents, and more. VSCode makes working on servers much easier as you can have a text editor open to edit your scripts to save them directly on the server you are working on, have a file manager open for a more traditional view of the file tree, as well as having multiple terminals open simultaneously.

### Connecting to Uppmax servers with VSCode
- Open VSCode
- `ctrl+shift+p`
- `Remote-SSH: Add new SSH Host`
- Follow login instructions on [Uppmax support](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/user-guides/guide--first-login-to-uppmax/)
- Add the info to the first .ssh file prompted
- `ctrl+shift+p`
- `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host`
